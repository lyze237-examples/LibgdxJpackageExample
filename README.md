# LibgdxJpackageExample
Example app to show off how to build a libgdx app with jpackage and github actions

Whenever someone commits (or pr gets merged) to master then the app gets built in github actions and creates all sorts of installers for windows/mac/linux.

This repo is currently in early stage and only the gradle file is nearly finished.
